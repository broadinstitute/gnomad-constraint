# gnomad-constraint

This repo contains code for generating constraint metrics for gnomAD. An overview of the pipeline and functions that are used can be found in [/gnomad_constraint/flowchart/constraint_pipeline_v4.pdf](./gnomad_constraint/flowchart/constraint_pipeline_v4.pdf). Note that many functions are imported from the [gnomad_methods](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad_methods) repo.
